# 🌐 MeshOffice — AI-Native Work Orchestration OS  
**Autonomous Workflows • AI-Managed Pods • Deep Talent Intelligence • Hiring & Execution in One Place**

MeshOffice is an AI-native platform that replaces traditional job boards, freelancing sites, and project management tools with a **single intelligent operating system** that understands work, finds the right people, breaks work into tasks, and manages the entire execution autonomously.

It combines:
- AI workflow orchestration  
- Autonomous team assembly  
- Talent intelligence  
- Hiring automation  
- Real-time project tracking  
- A two-way marketplace for workers & employers  
- A unified user profile system  
- A dedicated LLM-powered backend (“MO Brain”)  

MeshOffice is built using **React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind, shadcn-ui**, and integrates with **Supabase** for database, auth, and backend functions.

## 🚀 What is MeshOffice?

MeshOffice is an **AI-first Work OS** that lets users say:

> “MO, I need this done in X time with Y budget.”

And MO automatically:
1. Understands the request  
2. Breaks it into tasks  
3. Assembles the right team (freelancers or full-time candidates)  
4. Assigns work  
5. Tracks progress  
6. Validates deliverables  
7. Sends the user only the final output  

On the other side, workers can join pods, get tasks assigned by AI, and get paid once their work is validated.

MO selects talent based on:
- skills  
- experience  
- pricing  
- availability  
- embeddings  
- performance history  

### **3. Automatic Task Decomposition**
Large projects → structured task graph  
Tasks → milestones → dependencies → owners

### **4. Autonomous Work Execution**
MO manages the entire lifecycle:
- task assignment  
- deadline tracking  
- progress monitoring  
- resolving blockers  
- quality control  

### **5. Real-Time WorkGraph Dashboard**
Visual tracking of:

- **switch roles dynamically**  

### **7. Deep Candidate Intelligence**
MO builds an internal capability graph by analyzing:
- resumes  
- informal conversational inputs  
- previous work  
- pricing patterns  
- behavioral signals  

### **8. AI Hiring Assistant**
For full-time roles, MO handles:
- job description generation  
- candidate discovery  
- screening & ranking  
- shortlisting  
- interview question generation  

### **9. End-to-End Freelance Workflow Automation**
