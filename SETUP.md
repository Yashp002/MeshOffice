# MeshOffice Application Setup Guide

## Overview

MeshOffice is an intelligent candidate discovery platform built with React, TypeScript, Convex backend, and AI-powered matching using Google's Gemini API.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm/bun
- A Convex account (free at [convex.dev](https://convex.dev))
- A Google Gemini API key (optional, for AI matching - get one at [makersuite.google.com](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey))

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

or if using bun:

```bash
bun install
```

### 2. Set Up Convex Backend

1. Sign up for a free Convex account at [convex.dev](https://convex.dev)
2. Create a new Convex project
3. Install Convex CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g convex
```

4. Login to Convex:

```bash
npx convex dev
```

This will:
- Ask you to login/create account if needed
- Create a new project or link to an existing one
- Generate a `.env.local` file with your `VITE_CONVEX_URL`

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# Convex Configuration (auto-generated by 'npx convex dev')
VITE_CONVEX_URL=https://your-project.convex.cloud

# Gemini API Key for AI-powered matching (optional but recommended)
# Get your key from https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

For the Gemini API key:
- Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
- Create a new API key
- Add it to your `.env.local` file
- **Important**: Add `GEMINI_API_KEY` to your Convex dashboard environment variables:
  1. Go to your Convex dashboard
  2. Navigate to Settings → Environment Variables
  3. Add `GEMINI_API_KEY` with your key value

### 4. Deploy Convex Functions

Run the Convex development server (this also watches for changes):

```bash
npx convex dev
```

This will:
- Push your schema and functions to Convex
- Watch for changes and auto-deploy
- Keep the connection alive

### 5. Start the Development Server

In a new terminal window:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

## Key Features

### 1. Candidate Management
- Add candidates with skills, experience, and resume
- View all candidates in a list
- Skills tagging system

### 2. Job Posting
- Create job postings with requirements
- Define required skills and experience level
- Location and description

### 3. AI-Powered Matching
- Semantic matching using Google Gemini AI
- Score candidates based on job requirements
- Detailed reasoning for each match
- Fallback matching algorithm if AI is unavailable

### 4. Dashboard
- Real-time statistics
- Activity overview
- Quick actions

## Authentication

The app uses Convex Auth with:
- Password-based authentication
- Anonymous sign-in for quick testing

To use authentication:
1. Sign up/in through the UI
2. Create a password account or use anonymous sign-in
3. All operations are tied to authenticated users

## Using the Application

### Workflow

1. **Add Candidates**
   - Navigate to "Candidates" in the sidebar
   - Fill in candidate information
   - Add skills and resume text
   - Save

2. **Create Jobs**
   - Navigate to "Jobs" in the sidebar
   - Fill in job details
   - Add required skills
   - Post the job

3. **Match Candidates**
   - Navigate to "Matching" in the sidebar
   - Select a job
   - Click "Match" button
   - View ranked candidates with match scores

4. **View Dashboard**
   - See overview of jobs, candidates, and matches
   - Quick actions to create new items

## Troubleshooting

### Convex Connection Issues

- Ensure `VITE_CONVEX_URL` is set in `.env.local`
- Run `npx convex dev` to establish connection
- Check Convex dashboard for deployment status

### AI Matching Not Working

- Verify `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set in Convex environment variables
- Check Convex function logs for errors
- The system will fallback to rule-based matching if AI fails

### Build Errors

- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
- Check Node.js version (18+ required)
- Clear node_modules and reinstall if issues persist

## Deployment

### Frontend

The frontend can be deployed to any static hosting:
- Vercel
- Netlify
- Cloudflare Pages

Set environment variable `VITE_CONVEX_URL` in your hosting platform.

### Backend

Convex backend is automatically deployed when you run `npx convex dev` or deploy via the Convex dashboard.
